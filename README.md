# Customized-package-for-Representational-similarity-analysis

This analysis was inititally developed by Kriegeskorte et al (2006) for the computation of multi-voxel pattern similarity of MRI BOLD image.

The scripts are the customized (simplified) version for representational similarity analysis, and was made for the paper published here:

## Docs:

1. preprocess MRI image e.g. using FSL. 
2. obtain multi-voxel pattern by creating a 1st level univarite GLM.
3. use 'ct_by_voxel_fsl.m' to compute correlation matrix across trial-pairs for each image voxel.
4. use mvpa_analysis_fsl_glm to compute representational similarity by create a 2nd level GLM.

Note that recoding will be needed for your case.
